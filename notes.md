NEED SCcrollbar for porps window
background texture .. 
parent classses dont' work .. these need to work .. 


so what we do is we add a class to a single root element, 
  then the class gets inherited to each other element. That way we don't nave to pass a class in to each new().
setting uiref texture to null means .. that we use defaultpixel.


* topo - build on top of World.cs
* get renderer to alias
* variable block heights for different world areas
* Rename world to WorldArea, we are not infinite.
* Remove generation code.
* So, keeping dromes, i think the reason for dromes was that Glob files were too many and it was slow.
