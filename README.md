# OpenGL + C# On Linux via OpenTK

Making this minecraft clone thing and we're not going C++. No way. Java, not a fan. C# .. but on Linux. OpenTK can handle that.

This is a test of OpenTK on Linux. I used this in the past and really liked it. It seems to work so far.

# How to Run

The easy road here is MonoDevelop. Simply go to MonoDevelop.com and follow the steps to install it. I am on Ubuntu right now and the steps worked perfectly as of Jan 10 2022.

The package manager in MonoDevelop should detect the correct OpenTK packages. The newest versions of OpenTK aren't compatible, probably due to .NET version. I selected v3.1.
